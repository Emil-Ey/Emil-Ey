### Hi there 👋

Computer Science student with an interest in Full-Stack Web-applications.
I love working with GraphQL, so I use it a lot in my projects. I also like working with TypeScript.

Currently working on:
* [ToDoList app](https://github.com/Emil-Ey/To-Do-List-App) (In progress, but almost ready to deploy.)
  * Made using GraphQL, TypeScript, React, PostgresQL, Redis, Node, TypeOrm, Urql, Express, and Chakra UI.
* [TravelBuddy-app](https://github.com/Emil-Ey/TravelBuddy) (In planning / design / preparation phase)
  * Haven't decided which tools will be used for this project.
