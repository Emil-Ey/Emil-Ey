### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my GitHub

Computer Science student with an interest in Full-Stack Web-applications.
I love working with GraphQL, so I use it a lot in my projects. I also like working with TypeScript and React.

Currently working on:
* [ToDoList app](https://github.com/Emil-Ey/To-Do-List-App) (Deployed, working on more features)
  * Made using GraphQL, TypeScript, React, PostgresQL, Redis, Node, TypeOrm, Urql, Express, and Chakra UI.
  * [Check it out](https://eybye-todo.xyz/)
* [TravelBuddy app](https://github.com/Emil-Ey/TravelBuddy) (In planning / design / preparation phase)
  * For this project I will be using the famous MERN stack.

Also check out my personal website: https://emil-ey.github.io/
* Made using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Bootstrap. Deployed using GitHub Pages.
